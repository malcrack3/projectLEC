                    It's fine, it's cool<br>
                    You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth<br>
                    And guess I'm the fool<br>
                    With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof<br><br>
        
                    I don't wanna call it off<br>
                    But you don't wanna call it love<br>
                    You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"<br><br>
        
                    You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
                    Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling<br>
                    You can say it's just the way you are<br>
                    Make a new excuse, another stupid reason<br>
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br><br>
        
                    I'm cliché, who cares?<br>
                    It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair<br>
                    And I cry, it's not fair<br>
                    I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air<br><br>
        
                    Think I'm gonna call it off<br>
                    Even if you call it love<br>
                    I just wanna love someone who calls me "baby"<br><br>
        
                    You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
                    Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling<br>
                    You can say it's just the way you are<br>
                    Make a new excuse, another stupid reason<br>
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>

                    When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night<br>
                    With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife<br>
                    And when you think about me, all of those years ago<br>
                    You're standing face to face with "I told you so"<br>
                    You know I hate to say, "I told you so"<br>
                    You know I hate to say, but, I told you so<br><br>
        
                    You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
                    Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (well, I told you so)<br>
                    You can say it's just the way you are<br>
                    Make a new excuse, another stupid reason<br>
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
